# Word count

Learning & comparing functional programming languages implementing word count algorithm.

## Algorithm

1. Count frequency of each distinct word in a text document.
2. Output 100 most common words and their count.

## Implementations

* Clojure, [word-cloud-clj](./word-count-clj/README.md)
* Haskell, [word-cloud-hs](./word-count-hs/README.md)
* Rust, [word-cloud-rs](./word-count-rs/README.md)
